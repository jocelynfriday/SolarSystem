# SolarSystem
A 3D computer graphic of the Solar System written in C++ and using OpenGL.  In order to have both the Sun and Murcurry visible simultansously, the model ignores size ratios and accurate orbiting paths.  

The project uses concepts such as coordinate transformation, hidden surface removal, lighting using local and global illumination models (ray-tracing and radiosity), surface detail using texture and real-time user interaction.

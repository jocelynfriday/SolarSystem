# SolarSystem
A 3D real-time computer animation of the Solar System written in C++ and OpenGL.  In order to have the Sun, Mercury and small asteroids visible simultansously, the model ignores size ratios and accurate orbiting paths.  

The project uses concepts such as coordinate transformation, hidden surface removal, lighting using local and global illumination models (ray-tracing and radiosity), surface detail using texture and real-time user interaction.
